<h1 style = "color:blue"> Object Detection Using TensorFlow API</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> This projects aims at object detection with a very high accuracy using pre-trained light weight SSD-MobileNet V3 architecture. 
My project describes how object detection models can be trined very easily and accurately using the TEnsorFlow API.
Here we have also used OpenCV in order to draw the rectangles around the objects and also to load the pre-trained frozen TensorFlow models.
<h4>Challenges  :</h4>
The main challenge faced by me was getting the config file which I finally found at https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API which is the wiki page of TensorFlow API . 
<h4>Technologies Used  :</h4>OpenCV 
</p>
<h2>Installations</h2>

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install opencv and matplotlib .
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
<h2>BrainStorming</h2>
<h4>Image Classification/Recognition</h4>
<p>It is the process of classifying the images to the categories they belong to based on their salient features.</p>
<p>Deep learning Algorithms for Image Classification:</p>
-AlexNet
-GoogleNet
-MobileNet
-VGGNet
