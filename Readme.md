<h1 style = "color:blue"> Object Detection Using TensorFlow API</h1>
<h2>Know me</h2>
<p> This projects aims at object detection with a very high accuracy using pre-trained light weight SSD-MobileNet V3 architecture. 
My project describes how object detection models can be trined very easily and accurately using the TEnsorFlow API.
Here we have also used OpenCV in order to draw the rectangles around the objects.
